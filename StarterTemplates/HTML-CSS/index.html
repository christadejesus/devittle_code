                    <p>This starter template features HTML and CSS only.  I've included just enough elements, styling, and responsiveness to get you started. Feel free to fork this repository to save your own copy to start customizing and building your next project.</p>

                    <p>This is a second section with the same content-area as the section above. In this template, content areas are created by adding the <code>.content-area</code> class to any block level element such as a div, section, or article. Content areas are designed to keep page content responsive and aligned both vertically and horizontally.</p>

            <section class="content-area accent-area">
                <h2 class="accent-heading">I'm an h2</h2>
                <p>This is an accent-area. You can create this area by adding the <code>.content-area</code> class and the <code>.accent-area</code> class to any block level element such as a div, section, or article. In this template, an accent area spans the full width of the page while keeping the content responsive and aligned with other content areas.</p>
